This project was used to enter Launchcode's Apprenticeship program.  The project is now called 'MovieLot.'  

The application's purpose is to allow the user(s) to create a collection of all the movie titles they own with pertinent information 
about each title.

As a lover of movies who often has friend's over for "Movie Night," I found that a lot of time was spent determining which movie from my collection would be watched.  I figured an app that would allow a user to keep track of their movie collection and allow others to view what titles were owned could help with this process.  

The user could send a friend a link to their collection and that friend could determine what they were interested before heading over.  The app allows a user to access the API from The Movie Database (themoviedbb.org), to gather information to be displayed for each title (Poster Art, trailers, cast, crew, etc.).  This information can also be added manually by the user.

The app also allows for the user to include information about the type of media (4K, Blu-ray, DVD, etc.), audio source (Atmos, DTS:X, Dolby True HD, Stereo, etc.), Aspect Ratio, and to include a rating and comments on the film.  Users that have a Constant Image Height projection and/or high-end audio setups can easily refer to some of this information so they can properly adjust their settings prior to movie playback.  For example - someone with a 2.35:1 screen can know ahead of time to apply screen masking prior to playback of a movie with a 16:9 aspect ratio.  And users may want to adjust their speakering configuration settings based on if they are playing Atmos, DTS:X or using an upmixer.

The app offers various searching, sorting, and filter options.  Users can make individual films in their collection private, or make their entire collection private as well.  

There's still plenty of work that can be done on it, especially on the front-end.  The look has been secondary up to this point in development.
